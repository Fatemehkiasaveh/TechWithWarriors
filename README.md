# Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning tasks completed during the Machine Learning Internship at TechWithWarriors. Each task is implemented using different machine-learning techniques and datasets.

## Task 01: Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

**Description:**
This task involves implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing Dataset. The model is built using scikit-learn, a powerful Python library for machine learning.

**Dataset:**
- **California Housing Dataset**: This dataset contains information on various housing features like the number of rooms, population, and median house values for California districts.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Features**: Various features from the dataset were used to predict the target variable (house price).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `MachineLearning` directory.
2. Open the `linear_regression_california_housing.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

**Results:**
- The model achieved an R-squared score of **XX** on the test set, indicating the percentage of variance explained by the model.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Model**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Features**: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `MachineLearning` directory.
2. Open the `decision_tree_iris_classification.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

**Results:**
- The model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set, successfully classifying the iris species.

## Task 03: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for MNIST Image Classification

**Description:**
This task involves implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

**Dataset:**
- **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each image is 28x28 pixels.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `MachineLearning` directory.
2. Open the `knn_mnist_classification.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

**Results:**
- The KNN model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set, correctly identifying the handwritten digits.
